# 🚀 Laurian Jamin Portfolio | Software Developer & Engineering Student

This repository contains the source code for my professional online portfolio. It showcases my academic and professional journey as a **Software Developer and Engineering Student at ISIMA** (Clermont-Ferrand), specializing in **Full-Stack Development**, **Data Science**, and **Cybersecurity**.

The website is designed to be fully **bilingual (French/English)** and presents my skills, my work-study experience at **Enedis**, and my key academic projects in detail.

## ✨ Project Features Overview

* **Fully Bilingual:** Dynamic language switching (FR/EN) for all content (titles, descriptions, buttons).
* **Responsive Design:** A modern and adaptive user interface, optimized for all devices.
* **Detailed Timeline:** Chronological presentation of my **Professional Experience (Enedis)** and my **Education (Data Science Bachelor's, ISIMA)**.
* **Detailed Projects:** Dedicated pages for three major academic projects:
    * **Larrythmique:** Shazam-like music recognition application (Electron.js, C#, Signal Processing).
    * **HolaCiné:** Movie platform with a hybrid recommendation system (TypeScript, Deno, MySQL).
    * **Akinator:** Mathematical guessing game based on Shannon entropy (Python).
* **Contact:** Functional contact form (via Formspree) and direct links to my professional networks (LinkedIn, GitHub).
